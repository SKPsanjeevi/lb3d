Showspheres visualizes spheres with different colors and radii in 3D using VTK.

The input files have 3-5 cols separated by tabs:
x	y	z	radius	color

Radius and color are optional (see options!)
color is a float from 0 to 1 where 0 means red and 1 means blue.

Defaults can be set in spheresdefaults.py
