This is the glballs by Martin Strauss, a visualization tool using OpenGL and QT

The program uses autoconf to guess your system configuration. (see ./configure --help)

try 
./configure
make

To build the program on a platform you might have to go to the CONFIG directory, 
and prepare a configuration file.

then, try 
configure
make

if this fails, try

make distclean
rm configure
make configure
./configure
make

if this still fails, consider changing the configuration file

if you still have no success, have a look at the config.log
and as a last solution see the .in files, maybe you have to change something there)

when the compilation was successful, you have a file src/glballs
which you can execute, or copy it to some bin-directory, if you like


The file you are reading has been added afterwards by Martin Hecht to assist you when
trying to compile the program. I have also modified in some detals of the
configure scripts. My changes to make the program compile on the SUSE 64
bit installations were the following: 

- changed the occurences of "lib" to "lib64" in Makefile.config.in
- removed the -march=i686 option from CONFIG/g++ OPTFLAGS
- changed -lqt to -lqt-mt in src/Makefile.in
- corrected the brackets in D/D_CGL.cc on line 312 and 316 according to
  the suggestions of g++ v. 4.3.1 

maybe you have to change the things back if you don't have yet a 64 bit
architecture or if your installation did not introduce lib64 directories
