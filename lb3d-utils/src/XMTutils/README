XMT Data
=============================

The .tom file contains the raw XMT data. This consists of a 512-byte
header, followed by the digitized rock, as a 3D array of 8-bit unsigned chars. 
Under UNIX, the header can be removed, for example with the dd(1) utility:

dd if=file.tom of=file.raw bs=512 skip=1

This creates a new file, file.raw, which contains *only* the raw data. 

Using the C utility xmt2ascii included here this 
raw data can be downsized and converted into an ascii rock file for LB3D.
The data are tresholded to create a bitmap (only 0's and 1's), and only the rock sites with their 
coordinates are written in ascii format.
If xmt2ascii_mirror is used the data are also mirrored respect to the xy plane.
