	User Guide for the Lattice-Boltzmann "lb3d" code
	       Binary Immiscible Numerical Test


The test consists in calculating the surface tension on two systems:
 (1) a planar interface between two immiscible fluids, and (2) a
 similar interface but containing surfactant molecules adsorbed at it
 as an initial condition.   

Two input files are provided to start the simulations of cases (1) and
 (2) above:

 input-file1
 input-file2

 Each of them sets up two planar interfaces perpendicular to
 axis Z, one at z=0 and other at z=NZ/2, on a lattice of size NX x NY
 x NZ, where NX=16, NY=16, NZ=128. The lattice length along Z is
 larger than the other two allows for enough space for the dynamics to
 relax to isotropy at regions far enough from the interfaces. The
 simulations run for 1000 time steps and dump output data files to
 disk every 10.

The code (`./lbe`) assumes that the input file is in the same directory
 where the former is (./), and that two directories have been created
 afresh by the user:

 ../output/pl_tst_NS
 ../output/pl_tst_S

 corresponding to input-file1 and input-file2, respectively.

Once the simulation finishes and the bunch of (output XDR) files are
 produced, please perform the compilation:

	./Post_planar/make

 which produces an executable named `./Post_planar/sigma`. This is a
 code used to postprocess the files 'p??_*_t??????.xdr' produced by
 `lb3d`, where the first wildcard group stands for any of: 'xx', 'xy',
 'yy', 'xz', 'yz', 'zz'; the second is the string 'gr_out_file' read
 from the input file ('pl_tst_NS' or 'pl_tst_S'), and the last if the
 time step. Please run it with the -h flag to learn about the command 
 arguments it takes. The output of `./Post_planar/sigma` is two
 files, e.g.:

	pressprep_pl_tst_S.dat
	sigma_pl_tst_S.dat

  The first file contains pressure tensor data and the second contains
  three columns: 

	[ts]  [surf]  [incr]

  where [ts] is the time step, [surf] is the surface tension, and
  [incr] is how much larger is [surf] (in %) with respect to the
  previous time step.


			  >>>IMPORTANT<<<

  The benchmark that this test entails comes in when we look at the
  last line of the second file. For example: 

       % tail -1 sigma_pl_tst_S.dat
       1000          0.00237867              0.51501612

  which, in the example, means that at time step 1000 the surface
  tension of the planar interface reached the value 0.00237867
  (force/length) and is 0.52% larger than it was at the previous time
  step. 

  The example .dat files in this directory have been created using
  input-file1 on a dual processor Linux PC.
