Syntax: ./h5converter <inputfile> [-hdf5] [-xdr] [-noflip / -cfflip / -flip <n>]

h5converter takes a path to a file <inputfile> as its only required argument. If it contains .xdr it's treated as an xdr file, while .h5 is treated as HDF5.
If the -xdr flag is set, an XDR file is written. If -hdf5 is set, an HDF5 file is written. 
If -noflip is set, the array is not changed, -cfflip changes C-style arrays to Fortran-style or vice-versa, fior -flip <n>, look at the code. If none are specified, 
the option is read from stdin at runtime.
Other options are read from stdin and can be put into a text file and piped into the program for batch jobs.

For an XDR file, you need to specify the dimensions by hand (because this information is not contained within the file format). It is assumed the XDR file contains floats.
For an HDF5 file, you need to specify the dataset name (for LB3D usually 'OutArray'), and the dimensions will be read from the dataset automatically.

The output file(s) will then be written to <inputfile>-out.[h5/xdr].
