This subdirectory contains a version of struct_xdr which is different
to the one in ../struct_xdr . Its features are:

* This version is only single precision, as opposed to both sgl and
dbl present in ../ .

* This version, as well as that in ../ , contains two methods of
computing standard errors, METHOD A and B, as explained below.

* This version includes two new features: calculation of the
(unaveraged) 3D SF, and calculation of cartesian moments of the 3D SF
and their relevant lateral domain sizes, as explained below, useful
for shearing studies.

* The version in ../ takes the field 'arr' as an input in addition
to 'colour', 'od', 'wd', 'owd' and 'sur' (when compiling with
Makefile_B sgl). This version does not take 'arr' as an input field.

Notes

[1] 
On IRIX64, when optimising with -O3 -64 -mips4 a bus error pops up. 


[2] 
Files *_B.c compute the standard error as:

    stderr = \sqrt(\sigma^2 / N)

where \sigma is directly the avg of sqrd residuals:

   \sigma^2 = 
   \frac{1}{N-1}\sum (x_j - \bar x)^2

This we'll call METHOD B, as opposed to METHOD A, which uses the more
common expression derived from expanding the ()^2, which is the avg of
sqrd data minus the sqr of the avg data:  

   \sigma^2 = \bar x^2 - (\bar x)^2.

Please use METHOD B unless efficiency is too compromised.


[3] 
Use Makefile_B in order to use METHOD B for computing the SDEV, and
dump the new Rx, Ry and Rz average domain sizes. These are computed
according to:  

   R_i = DPI / sqrt(iiS)

where i is the relevant cartesian component (in the 'i mod 3' set, i +
3 = i), DPI is twice pi, and iiS is the second order statistical
moment of the 3D structure function, S(\mathbf{k}), with respect to
cartesian component i, namely:  

   iiS = 
   \sum_{i+2}\sum_{i+1}\sum_i (k_i)^2 S(\mathbf{k}) /
   \sum_{i+2}\sum_{i+1}\sum_i S(\mathbf{k})

where LaTeX notation has been used, the sums run from 1 up to the
lattice lateral size, N_i, and the i-th component of the wavevector
is: 

   k_i = (DPI/N_i) n_i

where n_i is an integer.


[4]
Use Makefile_B_3DSF to dump only the unaveraged SF (using METHOD B)
and not Rx, Ry and Rz.
