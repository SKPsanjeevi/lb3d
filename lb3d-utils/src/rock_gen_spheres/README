Syntax: ./rock_gen_spheres <filename>

rock_gen_spheres generates a rock geometry consisting of multiple spheres - regularly or randomly (overlapping or non-overlapping) and writes it to an HDF5 output file <filename>.h5
Plain text and XDR can also be enabled as output.

The rock_gen_spheres.sh helps automate the process of generating geometries of non-overlapping random spheres (since the program might not be able to place all spheres, multiple tries might be needed -
if the program fails in this way, the exit code will be 2).
