How to obtain the permeability of a sample
------------------------------------------

I. How to create rock files from raw files
------------------------------------------

If one does not have a proper lb3d rock file, but typical greyscale
discretizations, one has to convert and threshold them:


1.) Convert the raw file to ascii.
./raw2ascii <file.raw >file.ascii

2.) threshold it.
Edit threshold value (th) and system size (M) in thres_mCT.f and
recompile.

./thres_mCT

We now have file.ascii.thresh

4.) Use "createtunnel" to generate an XDR rock file with inflow region and
surrounding tunnel. Make sure the resulting lattice can be evenly
distributed on the preferred numer of processors.

Example:

./createtunnel file.ascii.thresh 100 100 100 128 128 128

This tool should create a VTK file as well as an XDR rock file.


II. Calculate permeabilities
----------------------------

1.) Run lb3d with the following settings:

obs_file = 'yourfile.xdr'
boundary_cond = 0

sci_od = .true.
sci_vel = .true.
(frequencies depend on your needs)

init_cond = -3
fr = 0.7
inv_fluid = 0

tau_r = 0.857
g_accn = 0.0001 (might have to be changed)
g_accn_min = 1
g_accn_max = 5
dump_format = 'hdf'
dump_double = .true.

2.) Adopt header lines in mflowscript.sh and run it in your data
directory. This script calls "zvelocity" for every set of od/vel files and
computes the permeabilities.

3.) For checking the time dependence of the permeability, use
mkpermtime.sh in order to grep permeabilities and timesteps from the
individual output files of "zvelocity".
